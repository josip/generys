=== Generys, wanna-be web framework for Io ===

== What's the point? ==
Mostly it was a personal goal to learn a bit more about this amazing
language called Io. 
Another goal was to create a simple web framework which could
reliably serve lots of *data* -- no Views, templates, etc. -- all that can be done within browser,
why should I waste my money on expensive servers?

== How to use ==
Explore. :)

Place all your controllers into controllers/ and make sure you assign to
a variable whose name ends with "Controller", like "CarsController := Controller clone do(..."

== Model? ==
Nothing for now.
BUT there are plans to start work on CouchDB library,
if you would like to help -- feel free to do so :)

== How to run ==
cd to Generys directory and then type "io" in console window.


== Io additions ==
To work more easily with Io, Generys has few tricks:
You can use JSON syntax for Maps!
Yes, this is valid Io code:
  {colour: "Red", favourite: false}

With a small twist, in order to create list you can also use
curly brackets:
  {1, 2, 3} == list(1, 2, 3)

To access an item from Map or List you can use square brackets:
 anMap["colour"] == anMap at("colour")
 anMap["colour", "favourite"] == anMap select(key, value, key == "colour" or key == "favourite")
 
 anList[0] == anList at(0)
 anList[1,-1] == anList exSlice(1, -1)
 
 "string"[0] == 115
 "string"[0, 1] == "string" exSlice(0, 1)
 
== Code conventions ==
CodeConvetions := Object clone do (
method(argument,
  if(iShouldSpareLinesOnClosingBrackets,
    makeCodeLessLispy,
    makeCodeMoreLispy)
    
  if(iShouldBreakLongStatements,
    firstBlock()
    callThis()
  ,
    secondBlock()
    callThat()))

  botNotTooLispy := true
)
